## IDEAS

# Principle 1

Every piece of software can be morphed into any other in a step-by-step manner

E.g
  * "Hello World" in C, can be morphed into "Doom"
  * The Facebook source code, initially written in PHP,
can be morphed into Wordpress, also written in C
  * The first piece of software you ever wrote,
    can be re-designed into a professional, polished, product


# Low hanging
 * Apply suggestions from Inspect code
 * Add automatic formatting
 * Remove clutter comments
 * Refactor GridMonster 'test' into proper tests
 * Apply all IntelliJ suggestions, file by file
 * Look for primitive obsession, clean up

# Possible architectural patterns
 * Hexagonal architecture
 * Imperative shell, functional core


# Bigger things
 * Refactor to Kotlin
 * Multiplayer
   * Local
   * Over internet


# Product improvements

 * View status in game screen instead of window title
 * Fullscreen mode
 * Highscore list
 * Flashier graphics
   * Blocks lighted
   * Particles
 * Sound effects
 * Music!
 * Game menu
 * ...
